# Stink Bug Project

This repository holds the code and apps associated with modeling the spread of the Brown Marmorated Stink Bug to Minnesotaâ€™s cities using population, minimum temperature, and distance. The resulting prediction has been mapped in ArcGIS Online with predictions based on live data. 

The spread of Brown-Marmorated Stink Bugs threatens the native biodiversity throughout North America, including Minnesota. These bugs rely on humans as a dispersal method, and are therefore closely tied to population. Temperature, distance, and current presence also play an important role in rate of spread. A predictive model and accessible map of invasive risk will give the Minnesota DNR and Department of Agriculture the insight they need to effectively prioritize resources in performing invasive management. With estimated presence of individuals and risk of spread, local governments can be alerted to the potential spread of invasives for preventative measures.
